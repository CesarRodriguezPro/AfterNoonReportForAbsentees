this programs is intended to be run in the afternoon and compare the list of employees.
we use this program to find out who didn't clock in after lunch.
to do this we download 2 sets of data.

    1 - the employees activity to determent time they start working.  code = 34
    2 - current employee status to the determent.                     code = 37

after that we compare the names and prepare a report to be send to the foreman's email.
